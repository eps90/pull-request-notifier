# Contributing

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## General

1. Write clean code.
2. Follow SOLID and KISS principles in your code.
3. Ensure your feature is fully covered with tests.
4. If you're developing new feature, create a pull request to `develop` branch.
5. In case you have a hotfix to create, start making your changes from `master` and create a pull request to this branch.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Start developing your changes from `develop` branch`. This is a branch with awaiting features to be released.
2. Ensure that project still runs the build and passes all tests successfully.
2. Verify that the built application is starting without errors or other problems making it unusable. 
3. If needed, update README.md with installation instructions, necessary environment variables, paths, etc. 
4. Once Pull Request is made, automatic build is being fired on Travis and Codacy. Make sure it still passes.
5. The Pull Request will be merged once it's reviewed by repository owner and/or contributors 
and gets approvals from all people involved in a code review.

## Internationalization

### Application messages

1. Find a file with original English translations in `app/lang/en.json` 
and make a copy with name of desired language code, e.g. `de.json`
2. Replace original translations with messages in the chosen language
3. Load new messages file and add a location to language mapping in `app/helpers/i18n.ts`, e.g.:
```typescript
// ...
$translateProvider
    .translations('en', require('./../lang/en.json'))
    .translations('de', require('./../lang/de.json'))  // HERE
    .registerAvailableLanguageKeys(
        ['en', 'de'],
        {
            'en_*': 'en',
            'en-*': 'en',
            'de-*': 'de',                              // HERE
            'de_*': 'de',                              // HERE
            '*': 'en'
        }
    )
// ...
```
4. Create a pull request following [Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process) chapter

> *Note:* You can use [ngTranslateEditor](http://mrhieu.github.io/ngTranslateEditor) to create new translations from existing file.

  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
